# Why use MiddleWare
<p>
A middleware in data retrieval or checking systems acts as a bridge between different applications or services, simplifying their communication. It abstracts complexities, handles data formatting and protocol differences, and ensures security and authentication. Middleware improves scalability by managing connections and load distribution, enhances maintainability by isolating system components, and allows easier integration with various data sources or services. This results in more efficient, secure, and manageable systems for data retrieval and verification.
